Here is where I will write about topics that interest me and that I'm thinking about. Likely the articles will mostly be about deep learning. I've been studying machine learning since before it was cool, for about 10 years now, mostly on my own, but also as part of a MS degree and at work. Here are some of my other interests:

- physics/cosmology/science
- religion
- food/cooking
- tennis
- music/film/tv

Hope you enjoy the articles!
